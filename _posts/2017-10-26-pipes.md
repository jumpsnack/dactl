1. UpperCase

allows you to convert an input string into uppercase by using *&#124; uppercase* in the template

2. Date

lets you display a date in different formats by using *&#124; date*

3. Currency

transforms a number into a desired currency by using *&#124; currency*

4. Async

will unwrap the date from the provided ovservable stream by using *&#124; async*

Some pipes don’t require input parameters (such as uppercase), and some do (such as date: ‘medium’). You can chain as many pipes as you want.
The next code snippet shows how to display the value of the birthday variable in a medium date format and in uppercase

{% highlight typescript %}
(JUN 15, 2001, 9:43:11 PM): template = `<p> {{ birthday &#124; date: ‘medium’ &#124; uppercase }} </p>`
{% endhighlight %}
