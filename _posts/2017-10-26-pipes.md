Some pipes don’t require input parameters (such as uppercase), and some do (such as date: ‘medium’). You can chain as many pipes as you want.
The next code snippet shows how to display the value of the birthday variable in a medium date format and in uppercase
{& start &}
(JUN 15, 2001, 9:43:11 PM): template = `<p> {{ birthday | date: ‘medium’ | uppercase }} </p>`
