* UpperCase

allows you to convert an input string into uppercase by using `| uppercase` in the template

* Date

lets you display a date in different formats by using `'&#124; date'`

* Currency

transforms a number into a desired currency by using `'&#124; currency'`

* Async

will unwrap the date from the provided ovservable stream by using `'&#124; async'`

Some pipes don’t require input parameters (such as uppercase), and some do (such as date: ‘medium’). You can chain as many pipes as you want.
The next code snippet shows how to display the value of the birthday variable in a medium date format and in uppercase

{% highlight typescript %}
(JUN 15, 2001, 9:43:11 PM): template = {% raw %}`<p> {{ birthday | date: ‘medium’ | uppercase }} </p>`{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
